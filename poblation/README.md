## Welcome to Population


For the execution you must first read the file "INSTALL.md", once the libraries are installed you must execute the file "main.py": ``python3 main.py``. No parameters are required in this program.

- Once the program is executed, it will generate 2 jpg files called "Population-Model.jpg" and "NetGrowth-Model.png" in the root of the "poblation" directory that will contain a graph detailing the simulation performed in each case...
