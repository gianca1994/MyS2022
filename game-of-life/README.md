## Welcome to Game Of Life


For the execution you must first read the file "INSTALL.md", once you have installed the libraries you must execute the file "main.py": ```python3 main.py```


- If desired, you can use the parameters ```-r or --rows```, to delimit the number of rows the matrix will have and ```-c or --column``` for the number of columns. Example:

1. ```python3 main.py -r 5 -c 10```, generate a matrix of 5 rows and 10 columns.
2. ```python3 main.py```, will generate the default matrix, which will contain 10 rows and 10 columns.

- Once you have run the program, you must go to the "matrix.txt" file and change the 0 to a 1 in the boxes that you want to represent as "alive".

- Finally in the console you must press "enter" to run the game.
